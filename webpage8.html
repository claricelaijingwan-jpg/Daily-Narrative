		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">I won't say I am an expert in relationships, but I have truly been involved in one too many of these types of crap. Either I was the passive one or was the one that had a freaky crush on others.  </p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Undeniably, it was all a remarkable experience and will forever carry a lesson for my future journeys.  </p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:30px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Rationalists and possibilities</b></p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Having a relationship itself requires many aspects of consideration, regardless of the time needed to be invested, to how my life will be changed after indwelling in this relationship..</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">People often say "enjoy the process while it lasts", I begged it differ, I analyse and look at the ending of the chapter first. Weird? Yeah kinda. But in my defence, if you are already know that that day will soon come, there's no meaning in putting much effort and sacrifice into it. Being rational helps me predict what could and will happen, so when it actually happens, I am already prepared for it and can accept anything peacefully.  </p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:30px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Crushes and Heartbreaks</b></p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify"> Though I am not typically the type that would approach others first, but I did have crushes. The one I remember most is probably after the pandemic, we were getting back to school and I barely can communicate with anyone. While I had the initial name of "C" and his was "E", we were assigned to many groups and activities together because based on the name list. Unlike others, he would approach me first for anything, he would commend me on little things that others never notice, and he was respectful towards the things I like. He was always shining, so bright, and slowly leading me towards the light too. </p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify"> However there was no happy ending, no one broke the silents, or maybe it was just me and my fantasy that romanticised what was a normal friendship, either way I was absolutely sad, but I know when to give up. </p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify"> Probably that's about crushes, you get deeply attracted to someone, for some, any reason. Heartbeats are as lively as heartbreaks; they happen, and not every crush gets its happy ending. Just know that you deeply like someone before, from the deep of your heart, and that is enough. </p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:30px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Exes and oaths</b></p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Well regardless of those that didn't end up together, there were some that did, whether online or offline.</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Many breakups indeed, resulting from conflict, different goals and inevitable problems. Fortunately, I haven't had any "crappy" exes before. We're in no drama nor novel, we must be responsible for our actions, and be relieved that whatever happened, did happen. </p>

		<br>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Rethinking all the oaths and promises made along the way, from my first relationship to my most recent, it was all like dust that shattered with the breeze of wind. I am a very detailed thinker, and I noticed every unfinished promises. Whether it was just a promise made on a whim, or just really an unfulfillable dream, whatever the case is it doesn't matter anymore. </p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">I think the best way to end a relationship is to realise what to prioritise first, which is myself. Cut off clear and clean, not spreading any unnecessary rumours, respect each other's decisions, and just know that this was for the greater good.</p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:30px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;"><b>Lust and intimacy</b></p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Along my journey, I have also met some people that "said to put a liking on me", but I had a different perspective towards those "I like you"s. 
</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">During my internship, I had a lot of work that sometimes requires me to stay until late night at areas quite far from my house. My boss who was thoughtful knew it was dangerous for a gal like me to take grab home alone, so she insists on another coworker sending me home.  
</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Well, it's not that I don't like him or anything, but it feels weird around him. He likes to put his arms around my shoulder when we're ot-ing. In my defence, yes it was a normal thing for guys to do that, but I wasn't that close with him, I barely even knew him for a week at that time. I did move myself a bit far from him but he insisted on getting closer, sometimes asking "do you have a boyfriend", or "look they kinda ship us ain't that cute", he probably liked me, I guess? 
</p>

		<br>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">But it's weird, like I barely know about his personality and on the other hand him towards me as well. It's weird to show "romantic affection" towards a person you barely know about, unless it's based on looks or so, if so for me that is very lustful and a total red flag.  
</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">But in the end, he didn't cross the line fortunately and our story also ended after I finished my internship. 
</p>
		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">I will avoid any "touchy" people who proclaimed "liked me", because that is just a person wanting to take advantage of another girl/person, for me that is nothing different in being lustful. Just ewwwwwww. 
</p>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:30px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;"><b>To Conclude Everthing </b></p>
		<center><img src= "background12.jpg" width="750px" height="450px";>
		<p>From Legally Blonde</p></center>
		<br>

		<p style="font-family: Times New Roman; font-size:20px; color: Black; line-height: 1.5;" align="justify">Life is like a box of chocolate, you never know what you might get. Probably a lot of heartbreaks, probably a lot of uncertainty and self-doubt, but nevertheless know that fate will come when time has arrived. Always remember to love yourself before loving anyone else. You will meet a lot of people in your future, so don't be obsessed with that "one person you love". At this age, you should be chasing dreams, leveling yourself, and making every second worth. Love yourself before loving this world. ❤️
